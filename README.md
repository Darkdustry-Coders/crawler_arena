Mindustry crawler arena plugin
This is a mindustry gamemode plugin for the crawler arena gamemode - players will fight off waves of crawlers. Before using, take note that the enemies have no pathfinding and will only go to players in a straight line. Also make sure that the middle of the map and map edges are unobstructed for enemies and players to spawn.
